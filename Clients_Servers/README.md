### Protocols
```
A set of communication rules that both sides must agree to use when they are communicating
A client and a server agree to communicate via a list of rules aka protocol
```

### Client
```
Both the client and Server have an IP. In order for them to communicate they open up what's called a socket which is a channel where information is sent
They both agree on which language they will speak and each language is structured differently aka FTP and HTTP
The protocol(HTTP/FTP) sends information throught the socket between two devices via a protocol called TCP. The data is split into smaller little sections
along the socket. These small little sections are called packets
