### HOW TO WORK WITH PACKAGE.JSON
```
So say my friend wants to work with my application. He can clone it or download it but say he doesn't have a package
He can run the command npm install to install the latest programming language versions, This will save him the time from running npm install package A,
npm package B, etc. He can do it all at one go!
```
